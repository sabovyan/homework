# homework-3
this is homework #3 from 05.17.2020. the deadline is 05.23.2020.

//if you see any mistakes about this repo, please inform me as it is my second try and I would love to improve my skills.


Also I'd like to mention that I've tried to implement Array.isArray, Array.from and findIndex() methods but I didn't manage to do it. 
I will try to solve these challenges too. But if I won't succeed, I would highly appreciate it if you will share the script or logic how to solve it.
